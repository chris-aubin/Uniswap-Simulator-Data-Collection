# Uniswap-Simulator-Data-Collection

This repo contains the scripts that were used to collect the data necessary to backtest Uniswap v3 liquidity provision strategies using the Uniswap v3 simulation that I built as part of my senior (undergraduate) thesis in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. Because it has been my experience that completing even the most simple blockchain-related task tends to be far more complicated than it should be, I have focused on thoroughly documenting all of my code and explaining all of my decisions. I have erred on the side of including excess notes and observations in the hope of including anything that may be helpful to other developers. The keys/ URLs used to access APIs were deactivated as of making this repository public.
