# Uniswap-Simulator-Data-Collection

This repo contains the scripts that were used to collect the data necessary to backtest Uniswap v3 liquidity provision strategies as part of my senior (undergraduate) thesis in the Computer Science department at Princeton University. Because it has been my experience that completing even the most simple blockchain-related task tends to be far more complicated than it should be, I have focused on thoroughly documenting all of my code and explaining all of my decisions. I have erred on the side of including excess notes and observations in the hope of including anything that may be helpful to other developers.
